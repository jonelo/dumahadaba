# Downloads the SQLite database from https://github.com/CYB3RMX/MalwareHashDB/
# and dumps the content (MD5 hash values of malware and their descriptions)
# to a GNU/Linux compatible text hash file which has the following format:
#
# Values are separated by two blanks, first value contains the hash value,
# encoded in hex, lowercase; the second value contains a description,
# description may contain spaces. Example:
#
# f4c3fa43b5bdfaa0205990d25ce51c5a  Trojan.Win32.Emotet.471040.A
#
# You could use Jacksum to find malware on your disk(s):
#
# > jacksum -a md5 --wanted-list MalwareHashDB.dump.md5 --style linux .
